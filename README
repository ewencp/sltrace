sltrace
-------

This is a utility for collecting trace data from Second Life.  The
goal is to leverage existing libraries (primarily libomv) to be able
to collect large amounts of trace data automatically.  This includes
both automating the collection of trace data via a single client
connection over long periods of time (a long term first person view)
as well as coordinating a collection of clients, possibly across many
servers, to obtain the best possible aggregated information.

sltrace
-------

This is a utility for collecting trace data from Second Life.  The
goal is to leverage existing libraries (primarily libomv) to be able
to collect large amounts of trace data automatically.  This includes
both automating the collection of trace data via a single client
connection over long periods of time (a long term first person view)
as well as coordinating a collection of clients, possibly across many
servers, to obtain the best possible aggregated information.


Running
-------

To actually connect to Second Life and collect data, use the binary
sltrace/bin/sltrace.exe.  Most options for collection are controlled via command
line arguments. Arguments are of the form --argname=argvalue.  The following is
a list of core arguments; required arguments are marked as such and optional
arguments with defaults have them listed beside them.

 * first -- first name of account to log in with (required)
 * last -- last name of account to log in with (required)
 * password -- password of account to log in with (required)

 * url -- a secondlife protocol URL specifying starting location.  If omitted,
          your avatar will start where you last logged out
 * duration -- the time to run the trace for, e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s for 1 hour, 1
          minute, and 1 second respectively (default: 5m).

 * controller -- the controller to use for avatar movement. (default:
                 static-rotating)
 * controller-args -- arguments to the controller. Valid values depend on the
                 type of controller.  (default: none)

 * tracer -- tracer to instantiate, which controls what kind of trace is
             generated. (default: object-path)
 * tracer-args -- arguments to the tracer. Valid values depend on the type of
                  tracer. (default:none)

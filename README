sltrace
-------

This is a utility for collecting trace data from Second Life.  The
goal is to leverage existing libraries (primarily libomv) to be able
to collect large amounts of trace data automatically.  This includes
both automating the collection of trace data via a single client
connection over long periods of time (a long term first person view)
as well as coordinating a collection of clients, possibly across many
servers, to obtain the best possible aggregated information.

Documentation can be generated using doxygen by running 'make docs' from the
root directory.  It will be placed in sltrace/doc/html.  If you don't have
doxygen, the documentation is still readable in raw form; find it in sltrace/doc/.

For instructions on how to build and use sltrace, see the documentation
described above.

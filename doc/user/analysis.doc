/** \page analysis Analyzing Trace Data
 *
 *  <h3> Analyzing Trace Data </h3>
 *
 *  Most of the tracing code stores raw data as JSON files.  The analysis
 *  scripts are written in Python and stored in the scripts
 *  directory. Instructions on use will vary depending on the type of analysis
 *  you want to run.
 *
 *  Most analysis code parses a trace and provides methods to filter and work
 *  with the data.  Most analysis code provides classes or methods to access the
 *  data from Python as well as a command line interface for getting summary
 *  information or performing a specific operation (like graphing data).
 *
 *  <h3> Motion Paths </h3>
 *
 *  There are a number of analysis scripts which handle object's motion path
 *  traces.  The core script is object_path.py, which contains the
 *  class ObjectPathTrace used for performing all other operations.
 *  An ObjectPathTrace can handle reading a trace file generated by
 *  the ObjectPathTracer in sltrace.exe.  Related scripts which
 *  perform higher level operations are quake_motion_path.py which
 *  generates a motion path file for each moving object, and
 *  graph_motion_paths.py which generates a graph of those same
 *  paths.

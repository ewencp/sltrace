 *  <h3> Introduction </h3>
 *
 *  SLTrace is a utility for collecting and analyzing trace data from Second
 *  Life.  In order to be as flexible as possible as well as reduce the load on
 *  Second Life, tracing and analysis are split into two steps.  In the first
 *  step, the user specifies what data they want recorded and where in Second
 *  Life to collect the data from.  In the second step, these raw traces are
 *  loaded, cleaned up, and analyzed, either transforming it into a more useful
 *  format (e.g. extracting movement of individual objects) or just presenting
 *  summary data (e.g. number of objects, number of avatars, average object
 *  sizes, etc).
 *
 *  This user guide covers the tools used for both of these steps, as well as
 *  how to get the tools built.

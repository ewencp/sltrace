/** \page build Building SLTrace
 *
 *  <h2> Requirements </h2>
 *
 *  SLTrace depends on a few external libraries:
 *   - sltrace.exe requires:
 *    - Mono to build (http://mono-project.com, > 2.0)
 *    - libomv to connect to SL (http://lib.openmetaverse.org, 0.7)
 *
 *   - The post-processing scripts require:
 *    - Python (http://www.python.org, 2.6)
 *    - JSON library for python (json or simplejson, simplejson suggested for
 *      performance)
 *    - matplotlib for graphing (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
 *
 *  All the scripting requirements are soft -- you can run sltrace and work with
 *  the data without them, but some features of scripts (or some scripts
 *  altogether) will not function.
 *
 *  <h2> Building SLTrace </h2>
 *
 *  All the dependencies except libomv are generally provided as
 *  system packages. A script for building libomv and putting it in
 *  its expected location is included in the deps directory.  If you
 *  have svn, mono, and nant installed, run
 *   \code
 *   make deps
 *   \endcode
 *  from the top-level directory should properly install it. (It is
 *  installed locally in the sltrace directory, root permissions are
 *  not necessary). Note that the compile may not fully complete, but
 *  as long as the library was built this is not a problem (the test
 *  binaries are not used).
 *
 *  Assuming all dependencies are available, the top level Makefile
 *  will build the sltrace binary.  Run
 *   \code
 *   make
 *   \endcode
 *  from the top-level directory.  If successful, you should find that
 *  it has created sltrace/bin/sltrace.exe.

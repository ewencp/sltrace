 *  <h2> Introduction </h2>
 *  SLTrace is a utility for collecting trace data from Second Life.
 *  The goal is to leverage existing libraries (primarily libomv) to
 *  collect large amounts of trace data automatically.  This includes
 *  automating both the collection of trace data via a single client
 *  connection over long periods of time (a long term first person
 *  view) as well as coordinating a collection of clients, possibly
 *  across many servers, to obtain the best possible aggregated
 *  information.
 *
 *  This documentation is split into two parts.  The first part is a
 *  user manual that describes how to use the software to collect data
 *  from Second Life as well as transform raw traces into a more
 *  useful form.  The second part is a developer guide that describes
 *  the architecture of the system, how to extend it, and issues to be
 *  aware of when extending it.  The developer guide also discusses
 *  general issues with collecting data from Second Life.

 *                      analyze data from Second Life
 *   - \ref devguide - Guide for developers that want to extend the core sltrace
 *                      program or the analysis scripts

 *  <h2> Introduction </h2>
 *  SLTrace is a utility for collecting trace data from Second Life.
 *  The goal is to leverage existing libraries (primarily libomv) to
 *  collect large amounts of trace data automatically.  This includes
 *  automating both the collection of trace data via a single client
 *  connection over long periods of time (a long term first person
 *  view) as well as coordinating a collection of clients, possibly
 *  across many servers, to obtain the best possible aggregated
 *  information.
 *
 *  This documentation is split into two parts.  The first part is a
 *  user manual that describes how to use the software to collect data
 *  from Second Life as well as transform raw traces into a more
 *  useful form.  The second part is a developer guide that describes
 *  the architecture of the system, how to extend it, and issues to be
 *  aware of when extending it.  The developer guide also discusses
 *  general issues with collecting data from Second Life.
 *
 *  <h2> User Guide Contents </h2>
 *   - \ref userguide - Introduction to sltrace from a user perspective.
 *   - \ref sltrace - Guide for using sltrace to obtain single avatar
 *                    traces.
 *   - \ref scripts - A guide to the scripts that are provided for
 *                    working with raw trace files obtained from
 *                    sltrace.
 *
 *  <h2> Developer Guide Contents </h2>
 *   - \ref design - Justification of the design of sltrace given that
 *                   there are multiple ways to collect trace data
 *                   from Second Life.
 *   - \ref quirks - Discussion of difficulties encountered when
 *                   collecting and analyzing data from Second Life,
 *                   due to SL's design and quirks.
 *   - \ref architecture - Description of the architecture of sltrace
 *                   and how to extend it.
